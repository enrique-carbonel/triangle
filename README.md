# triangle
Python script that defines a class called triangle that represents a triangle and provides various methods to manipulate and calculate properties of the triangle. This project was made for my Systems Programming for Engineers class.

CONSTRUCTOR __INIT__ METHOD: The __init__ method initializes an instance of the triangle class with a given base and height.

SETTER METHODS: These methods set the values of the base and height, respectively, and print a message if the provided value is less than 0.

METHODS FOR CALCULATING VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF THE TRIANGLE:
  calc_side: Calculates the length of the triangle's side.
  calc_perimeter: Calculates the perimeter of the triangle.
  calc_area: Calculates the area of the triangle.
  calc_alpha and calc_beta: Calculate angles in degrees (alpha and beta) of the triangle using trigonometric functions.
